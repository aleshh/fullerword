# Fullerword

Currently under development, Fullerword is a personal dictionary app intended for writers. Ever looked up a new word and wanted to use it in your writing? Save the default definition or your own definition and tag the word. Once you've got a collection the list can be filtered by tag to find just what you're looking for.

Currently designed for phone-sized screens. Uses browser local storage to store data.

Built with Angular. Uses [the Oxford Dictionary API](https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com) and [Feather](https://feathericons.com) icons.

[Working demo](http://fullerword.alesh.com/explore). (Alpha)
